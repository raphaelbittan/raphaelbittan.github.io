      <li><strong><u>Mobility:</u></strong>&nbsp;Being Out-Sourced has specific advantages regarding stuff like routine, experience etc.. Yet it can sometimes be harsh to know which office, which CTO to talk to, how to present yourself, or to know all the details of how you got introduced.
      </li>
      <li><strong><u>Internal Dev:</u></strong>&nbsp;Develop Software, Open-sourced or not, for the company from the experience and insights of out-sourced work, such a fantastic strategy!</li>
      <li><strong><u>Teaching:</u></strong>&nbsp;Help HR with Bootcamp recruitments; provide new content for the Bootcamp, present and revue that content with alumnis.</li>
      <li><strong><u>Scaling with the Company:</u></strong>&nbsp;Attend crucial meetings, have a work to say and being taken into account.</li>
