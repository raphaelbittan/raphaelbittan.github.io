# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#     `bundle exec jekyll serve`
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
# Install all plugins from your Bundler group by running single command:
#    `bundle install`
