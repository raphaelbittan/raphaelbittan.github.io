  <p>This article describes how to install <a href="https://www.minerva-kb.com/" target="_blank">MinervaKB</a> plugin. Installing knowledge base is very easy and should not take more than a minute. We assume you already have a working WordPress installation and a user with admin privileges.</p>

## Plugin upload

First of all, login to your WordPress dashboard. In the left menu select `Plugins – Add New`.

On the opened Add Plugins page select `Upload Plugin` in the top left corner of the screen.

After the activation you will be redirected to Plugins page. Notice the message at the top of the screen, saying you should setup the knowledge base home page.

### Creating Home Page

If you already have a page you would like to use as knowledge base root, just click the link in the message and select it. In this tutorial we assume this is a fresh install and you do not have pages yet, so let’s go ahead and create one.

In the left menu select `Pages – Add New`. A new page edit screen will open. At this point we only need to enter some title and publish the page.

<small><strong>NOTE: </strong>We will use the title Knowledge Base throughout this guide, so please remember to replace it with any title you’ve selected.</small>

### Home Page setup

At this point you need to set your new page as knowledge base home page. In the left admin menu select `MinervaKB – Settings`.

![Setting Home Page]({{base}}/assets/img/posts/setting-home-page.png)

From the dropdown `“Select page to display KB content”` select your newly created page and press `Save Settings` in the top right area of the screen.

## Conclusion

That’s it, you have finished installing knowledge base. Congratulations! :bowtie: 
Your home page is set, you can open it and it should display the search already. Home page will start to display topics once you add any content. Please refer to articles on content creation to learn more about that. You can configure the home page layout in the `Settings` or you can use `Page Builder` to do that.
