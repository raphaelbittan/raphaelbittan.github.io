  <h1 style="text-align:center;">What is Full Stack Developer?</h1>

  <p><strong>FULL STACK DEVELOPER</strong> is an engineer who works on both client-side and server-side software. This type of software developer works on the Full Stack of an application meaning <em>Front End Technology</em>, <em>Back End Development Languages</em>, <em>Database</em>, <em>Server</em>, <em>API</em>, and <em>Version Controlling Systems</em>. Hence, the name "Full Stack" Developer.</p>

  <p>The name translates user requirements into the overall architecture and implementation of new systems. A Full-Stack Developer doesn't necessarily master all technologies. However, the professional is expected to work on the client as well as server sides and understand what is going on when developing an application. He or she should have a genuine interest in all software technologies.</p>

## Skills to become a Web Developer

### Why do you need a Full-Stack Developer?

Here are some prominent reasons why you should hire a full stack development professional:

- Full stack developer helps you keep every part of the system running smoothly.
- Full stack developer can provide help to everyone in the team and greatly reduce the time and technical costs of team communication.
- If one person plays different roles, it saves your company's personnel, infrastructure and operational cost.

### Skill sets required to become a Full Stack Developer:

1. Front-end technology

Full stack developer should master essential front-end technologies like [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). Knowledge of third-party libraries like [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp), [SASS](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/default.asp), [Angular] and [React JS](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp) is desirable.

2. Development Languages

Full stack engineer should know at least one server-side programming languages like [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp), [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp), [ASP](https://www.w3schools.com/asp/default.asp) etc.

3. Database and cache

Knowledge of various DBMS technology is another important need of full stack developer. [MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp), MongoDB, Oracle, SQLServer are widely used for this purpose. Knowledge of caching mechanisms like varnish, Memcached, Redis is a plus.

4. Basic design ability

In order to become a successful full stack developer, the knowledge of designing is also recommended. Moreover, the person should know the principle of basic prototype design and UI /UX design.

5. Server

Exposure to handling Apache or nginx servers is desirable. A good background in Linux helps tremendously in administering servers.

6. Version control system (VCS)

A version control system allows full stack developers to keep track of all the changes made in the codebase. The knowledge of Git helps full stack developers to understand how to get the latest code, update parts of the code, make changes in other developer's code without breaking things.

7. Working with API (REST & SOAP):

Knowledge of web services or API is also important. Knowledge of creations and consumption of REST and SOAP services is desirable.

Other Pieces of the Puzzle:

* Ability to write quality unit tests.
* He or she should have a complete understanding of automated processes for building testing, document, and deploying it at scale.
* An awareness of security concerns is important, as each layer has its own vulnerabilities.
* Knowledge of Algorithms and data structures is also an essential need for professional full stack developers.
* Self-Learner, reaching for quality code, maximum coverage, Optimization processes.

### What is a Software Stack? Which Stack should I learn?

Software stack is a collection of the programs which are used together to produce a specific result. It includes an operating system and its application. For example, a smartphone software stack includes OS along with the phone app, web browsers, and default applications.

The above list of skill sets for a full stack engineer could be daunting. You need to master a software stack based on your career goals, project and company requirement. Following is a list of popular software stacks.

Irrespective of the stack you choose, you will find similarities in the architecture and design patterns across different stacks

	LAMP stack

LAMP is a widely used model for web service stacks. Its name "LAMP" is an acronym of four open-source components.

L = Linux: An open source operating system
A = Apache: Widely used web server software
M = MySQL: Popular open source database
P = PHP: Server-side open source scripting language

These above-discussed components, supporting one another. Many popular websites and web applications run on LAMP stack, Example: Facebook.

	MERN stack

MERN is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies:

M = MongoDB: Popular NoSQL database
E = Express: Light and portable web program framework
R = React: A javascript library for building user interfaces
N = Node.js: A server-side JavaScript run time

This stack currently in the huge demand as it is widely used to develop web applications.

	MEAN stack

MEAN Stack Application Development is witnessing a growing trend in usage. MEAN is an abbreviation of:

M = MongoDB: nosql Database
E = Express: Easy to use light and portable web program framework
A = Angular.js: Robust framework for developing HTML5 and JavaScript- web programs
N = Node.is: a server-side JavaScript run time

## What does a Full Stack Developer do?

As a full stack developer, you may be involved in following activities:

* Translate user requirements into the overall architecture and implementation of new systems.
* Manage Project and coordinate with the Client.
* Write backend code in Ruby, Python, Java, PHP languages.
* Writing optimized front end code HTML and JavaScript.
* Understand, create and debug database related queries.
* Create test code to validate the applicaition against client requirement..
* Monitor the performance of web applications & infrastructure.
* Troubleshooting web application with a fast and accurate a resolution.
